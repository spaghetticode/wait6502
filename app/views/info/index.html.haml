    Today personal computers are ubiquitous, they all look the same with those gray square 
    metal boxes, but the digital world has not been always as boring as it is today.<br/>
    There was a time when computers where uncommon and truly expensive, when each model had
    a distinctive personality, was rather unfriendly and incompatible with the others 
    but still very fascinating.
    It all began during the mid 70s, when a group of hobbyists scattered
    across the USA started the personal computer revolution.

  %h3 Why yet another retrocomputing website?
  %p  
    This is for sure a good question. We believe there are many great resources
    about old computers around in the web, but we wanted our share of glory :-) <br />
    Besides, we aim to collect data that is not available anywhere else yet.
    For example we are interested in original retail prices of the items in our museum at 
    different times and in different locations during the days when those items where
    still available for sale.<br />
    If you wish you can help us right now, just browse to any hardware item page and fill in the data
    in the "help us" section.

    We also built an automated system that checks major ebay websites in order to track
    information on retrocomputing related items and their final prices.<br/>
    As many machines  are getting rarer and rarer the ebay marketplace is a good and quick
    resource to find them, so our data could become a useful reference for buyers who
    are willing to pay not more than the right price for those computers.
    On the other hand there are still many cheap or free computers around that can be easily
    found at flea markets, thrift shops, garage sales, friends houses, or arranging exchanges
    with other retrocomputing enthusiasts, so we encourage people to use as many sources
    as possible when looking for vintage computers.

  %h3 About WAIT 6502
  %p
    %img#pet_screenshot{:src => '/images/wait6502.jpg', :alt => 'PET screenshot'}
    The name of this site is a tribute to the famous Commodore PET Basic Easter
    egg command <code>WAIT 6502</code> that will fill out the little
    PET monitor with the string <code>MICROSOFT!</code>.<br />
    This website logo itself is a representation of the keys on the early PET keyboard,
    while the computer is represented in the page header and its keyboard is used in the
    computer navigation system. By now it should be clear to everyone that the designer
    of this site is a big fan of this machine.
  %p
    If you have any comment, idea, suggestion or just want to have some words with us about
    those old glorious computers please contact us, we would love to hear from you.
