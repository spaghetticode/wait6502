Acts As Permalink Plugin
========================

This is a very basic Rails plugin that makes permalink-like URLs easily definible in Rails.
Just download the plugin and in your models set

+acts_as_permalink :attribute+

where attribute is a regular model attribute or any other method defined for the model.
Rails will keep looking for records based on the numeric id of the permalink, so don't worry
about providing unique data for attribute.
The plugin uses ActiveSupport parametrize method, so Iconv library must be installed on the
server.
A simple spec suite is provided.


Example
=======

script/generate scaffold friend name:string surname:string

class Friend < ActiveRecord::Base
	acts_as_permalink :full_name
	
	def full_name
		[name, surname].join(' ')
	end
end

And you're ready to go.

In your controllers you should provide something to avoid search engines to index the same
page twice after you update your record data, something like this:

class FriendsController < ApplicationController

	def show
	@friend = Friend.find(params[:id])
	unless params[:id] == @friend.to_param
		headers['Status'] = '301 Moved Permanently'
		redirect to @friend
	end
end
