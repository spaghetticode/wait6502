EbayFinder
==========

Uses RESTful ebay find APIs to retrieve auctions information for given keywords and parameters.
Tipical set of url parameters accepted by ebay:

EbayFinder::Request.new(
  :query_keywords => keywords,
  :website        => :DE,
  :page_number    => 1,
  :max_entries    => 10,
  :category_id    => 160
)

Example
=======

Instantiate a request object (this will build the request url):
	request = EbayFinder::Request.new(:query_keywords => 'Commodore Amiga', :website => 'FR')

Request a response from ebay:
	response = request.response

Navigate through response items and info:
	response.total_items
	response.total_pages
	response.total_items.first.title
	response.total_items.first.view_item_url
